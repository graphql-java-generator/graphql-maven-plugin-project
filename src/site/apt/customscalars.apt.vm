Custom Scalars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* {Presentation}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This page is valid for <<both the client and the server>> mode.
  
  The graphql-maven-plugin accepts any GraphQL Custom Scalars.
   
  To add a Custom Scalar, you need to:

  * Declare it in your GraphQL schema (see {{{https://graphql.org/learn/schema/}https://graphql.org/learn/schema/}})
  
  * Provide a class that extends <{{{https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.graphql-java/graphql-java/2019-05-14T05-01-24-4fd3721/graphql/schema/GraphQLScalarType.html}graphql.schema.GraphQLScalarType}}>. 
  graphql-java respects the specification of {{{https://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/}graphql scalars}}
  
  * Describe in the pom.xml file the list of Custom Scalars for your project

  []

* {Declare the Custom Scalar in your GraphQl schema}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Very simple. And well documented in {{{https://graphql.org/learn/schema/}https://graphql.org/learn/schema/}}.
  
  It's just a matter of adding a line in your GraphQL schema, like the one below:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
scalar Date
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* {Provide a class that extends GraphQLScalarType}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This is, of course, the complex part. But you can use a Custom Scalar implementation coming from graphql-java, or from external libraries.
  
  There are three ways to provide a Custom Scalar implementation:
  
  
** {Implement a <graphql.schema.GraphQLScalarType>}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  You can create your own implementation of any GraphQL Custom Scalar.
  
  The main issue here, is that the <graphql.schema.GraphQLScalarType> isn't very documented, especially the <graphql.schema.Coercing> interface that 
  you'll use to implement the serialization and deserialization methods.
  
  To help you implement a <graphql.schema.GraphQLScalarType>, we provided you a good sample, that you can copy/paste/change: the 
  <{{{https://github.com/graphql-java-generator/graphql-maven-plugin-project/blob/master/graphql-java-runtime/src/main/java/com/graphql_java_generator/customcalars/GraphQLScalarTypeDate.java}com.graphql_java_generator.customcalars.GraphQLScalarTypeDate}}>.
  We pasted the javadoc for the <graphql.schema.Coercing> interface, so that you properly understand what's expected.

** {Use a Custom Scalar implemented by graphql-java}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  graphql-java provide Custom Scalar implementation in the <graphql.Scalars> class. As graphql-java doesn't provide javadoc, you can either checkout the 
  graphql-java project, or check {{{https://www.javadoc.io/static/com.graphql-java/graphql-java/2019-05-14T05-01-24-4fd3721/graphql/Scalars.html}this link}}, 
  as long as this link remains valid.

  You'll then just have to declare it in your pom (see below).
  
  
** {Use a Custom Scalar implemented by an external library}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  You can also use external libraries, provided that they provide an implementation that is a class, that extends <graphql.schema.GraphQLScalarType>.
  
  Just add the dependency in your pom, and declare it (see below).

  

* {Configure the pom, to indicate your Custom Scalar(s)}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Of course, in your project you can mix Custom Scalars implemented by you, provided by graphql-java or by external libraries.
  
  To declare a Custom Scalar implementation, you'll have to provide three informations:
  
  * The name of the GraphQL Custom Scalar Type. It must be exactly the same name as declared in the GraphQL schema, for instance <Date> in the above sample.
  
  * The full name of the java class that will contain values for this Scalar type, once in the java code. For instance <java.util.Date> in the above sample.
  
  * The implementation. It may be declared by one of the three ways below. Of course, you must use one and only one of these parameter, for each Custom Scalar :
  
    * graphQLScalarTypeClass: The full class name for the <graphql.schema.GraphQLScalarType> that will manage this Custom Scalar. For instance: 
    <com.graphql_java_generator.customcalars.GraphQLScalarTypeDate>.
	
	* graphQLScalarTypeStaticField: The full class name followed by the static field name that contains the <graphql.schema.GraphQLScalarType> that will manage 
	this Custom Scalar. For instance: <graphql.Scalars.GraphQLLong>.
	
	* graphQLScalarTypeGetter: The full class name followed by the static method name that returns the <graphql.schema.GraphQLScalarType> that will manage 
	this Custom Scalar. For instance: <org.mycompany.MyScalars.getGraphQLLong()>. This call may contain parameters. Provided that this a valid java statement.

  You can find the up-to-date value for this Custom Scalar definition {{{https://github.com/graphql-java-generator/graphql-maven-plugin-project/blob/master/graphql-maven-plugin-logic/src/main/java/com/graphql_java_generator/plugin/CustomScalarDefinition.java}in github}}
  
  Please find below a sample of the declaration in the pom. It's extracted from the allGraphQLCases samples.
